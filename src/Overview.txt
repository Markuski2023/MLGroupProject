Depending on the findings during EDA, additional analyses might be needed to further understand the data.

Addressing Prediction with Future Weather:
Since future weather is unknown, and you are using weather predictions (estimated weather) for the next 24 hours as

​
 , it is crucial to train the model in a way that it generalizes well to these estimated weather conditions.
Addressing Distribution Difference between Real and Estimated Weather:
The model needs to be aware of the discrepancies between real (observed) weather and estimated (predicted) weather, and it should be able to adapt to the differences in distributions between them.
Suggested Approach:
Two-Stage Training:

Stage 1: Train the initial model using observed weather data, allowing the model to learn the relationship between the actual weather conditions and solar power production.
Stage 2: Fine-tune the model using the discrepancies between estimated and observed weather data to adapt the model to the distribution of estimated weather.
Discrepancy Features:

Engineer features representing the discrepancies between observed and estimated weather conditions, allowing the model to learn the nature and extent of errors in weather predictions.
Domain Adaptation:

Use domain adaptation techniques like transfer learning or instance weighting to align the distributions of observed and estimated weather data.
Detailed Implementation:
Initial Model Training:

Train the model initially using the observed weather conditions and the corresponding solar power production as targets. This allows the model to understand the underlying relationship between actual weather conditions and solar power production.
Fine-Tuning with Discrepancy Features:

Create a new dataset where each instance has the discrepancy features (difference between estimated and observed weather conditions) and use this dataset to fine-tune the initially trained model. This step enables the model to adapt to the differences between real and estimated weather.
Weighted Samples or Transfer Learning:

If available, use advanced techniques like transfer learning to further align the distributions of observed and estimated weather conditions. Alternatively, assign higher weights to samples with higher discrepancies during the fine-tuning stage to emphasize learning from them.
Validation and Evaluation:

Validate the model's performance using a separate set with known observed weather conditions and solar power production.
Evaluate the model’s adaptability to estimated weather by testing its performance on instances where only estimated weather conditions are known.
Prediction with Estimated Weather:

Once the model is trained and validated, use the estimated weather conditions for the next 24 hours as

  to predict the solar energy production.
Model Selection:
Given the nature of the task, ensemble models like Gradient Boosting or Random Forests can be effective as they can handle complex relationships and interactions between features.
Neural networks with architecture suitable for domain adaptation, such as those utilizing attention mechanisms, can also be explored.
